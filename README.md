# ML-Projects
Here is a collection of projects I built while experimenting with existing models and libraries, sometimes building them completely from scratch. Since these are learning projects, they might not be perfect—better to check twice before using them! Contributions and ideas are always welcome.

## Projects Covered

| Project | Domain | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Digit Recognition](https://github.com/Avaneesh40585/Digit-Recognition) | CV | A PyTorch implementation of handwritten digit recognition on MNIST. Demonstrates a full training pipeline using a custom CNN architecture with data augmentation and regularization techniques. |
| [Email Classification with BERT & RoBERTa](https://github.com/Avaneesh40585/Email-Spam-Classification) | NLP | An email spam detection system comparing DistilBERT and RoBERTa models. Focuses on fine-tuning strategies like layer freezing and progressive dropout to optimize transformer performance. |
| [CIFAR-10 Image Classification with ViT](https://github.com/Avaneesh40585/CIFAR10-Classification) | CV | A Vision Transformer (ViT) implementation fine-tuned for CIFAR-10. Highlights techniques for regularizing transformers on smaller datasets and includes a script for custom image inference. |
| [Flickr8k Dataset](https://github.com/Avaneesh40585/Flickr8k-Dataset) | Multimodal | An organized distribution of the Flickr8k dataset containing images and text annotations. Structured for easy integration into image captioning and multimodal research projects. |
