# ML-Projects
I put together this set of machine learning projects as a way to dive deeper into real-world applications of data science and intelligent systems. Each project tackles a practical use case ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs statistical learning, deep learning specializations, or reinforcement learning ‚Äî with the goal of learning by doing. If you‚Äôre exploring ML and prefer building models over just reading about them, there‚Äôs a good chance you‚Äôll find something useful (or at least interesting) here. Contributions and ideas are always welcome!

## Domains Covered üåê

### Machine Learning Approaches

| Domain                        | Description                                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Statistical Learning (Traditional ML)** | Classical machine learning approaches including supervised learning (classification, regression) and unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction) using statistical methods and algorithms like SVM, random forests, and k-means clustering. |
| **Reinforcement Learning**    | Learning paradigm where agents learn optimal actions through interaction with an environment via rewards and penalties, enabling applications in game playing, robotics, autonomous systems, and sequential decision-making. |

### Deep Learning Specializations

| Domain                        | Description                                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Computer Vision** | Neural networks with multiple layers specifically designed for visual data processing, enabling advanced image recognition, object detection, semantic segmentation, and generative visual content creation. |
| **Natural Language Processing** | Deep neural architectures like transformers, BERT, and GPT models that process and generate human language, powering advanced chatbots, language translation, text summarization, and content generation. |
